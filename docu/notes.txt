STARTING FROM REST:
-changed test case 5 to having initial flow = 0.0 everywhere but no other changes to the code
should show no changes since no wind flow and constant free surface height 
but there are some significant winds going westward near the poles (e.g. around 10m/s after
around 10 days)
note- maybe this is a rounding error that has propagated through- decreasing timestep makes
it worse e.g. after 9 days with timestep 1200s have magnitudes of up to 5m/s but with 
600s have magnitudes of around 15m/s



WITH INITIAL WIND SPEEDS:
wind appears to flow eastward near poles in all simulations which should be in gradient 
wind balance- should be steady? this happens after around 10 days in the following cases:

-Test case 5 without mountains ( reset MOUNT(I,J)=0.0 for all lon and lat)
where:
zonal wind speed U = UBAR*COS(LAT)
UBAR = 20 
free surface height PHI = PHI0 - PHIAMP*SIN(LAT)**2/GRAV
with free surface height PHI0 = 5960
and PHIAMP is amplitude of phi (so divide by gravity to get surface height) in order to keep
flow in gradient wind balance 
PHIAMP = A*OMEGA*BAR + (UBAR**2)/2.0 
Checked this is in gradient wind balance by integrating equation 11 in Thuburn and Lagneau 1999
(f+u*tan(lat)/a) * u = -g/a * d(h+mountains)/d(lat) 

 
-Test case 2 with same initial conditions as 5 and with alpha = 0.0 (just to check it wasnt
something to do with mountains) and saw same results


Also changing timestep changes magnitude of results significantly: smaller timestep gives larger
speeds near poles- maybe this is a truncation error due to initially small speeds near the poles
(due to ubar*cos(lat) ) which might propagate in time with more timesteps = bigger error





Note also forcing term does not seem correct:
by printing PHI it appears that PHI is PHI'=PHI-PHIBAR 
so PHIBAR is added back on. Then must also times h_rad = 4000 by g  phi forcing = g* hforcing
Then divide by TAURAD = 1 day in units of seconds
